<!-- TITLE: Charting -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: This is all the theory that goes behind charting. -->

This tutorial is designed to help you become a better charter, even if you have zero experience. The tutorial will cover all the concepts that need to be known to become a success charter.

# Fundamentals
## Notes
The notes, also called gems, are the most important element in a chart. They make up what the player is going to be playing in the game. The notes should correspond to the music. 

In Clone Hero, there are 5 different **coloured** frets (from left to right): green, red, yellow, blue, and orange. There is also a purple note that is a line across the highway, called an Open Note. It is played by strumming while no frets are held on the controller. Open Notes are typically the lowest note heard in a song, then the frets are in ascending order from lower on the neck (green) to higher (orange).

There are 3 different **types** of notes: Strum, HOPO, and Tap.

When charting, the program will automatically determine Strums and HOPOs, but this can always be overwritten.

### Strums

**Strums** are the most common note found in charts. To play a Strum, hold down the corresponding fret and press the strum bar. 

Strums have a black ring with a white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color. 

Strums are used in charts when the notes are “new,” as there is a noticeable new attack.
As a general rule for guitar, Strums are used when the actual pick hits the strings. 

As a general rule for other instruments, Strums are used when a new note appears, but it is independent and has attack.

### HOPOs

**HOPO** stands for “Hammer-On, Pull-Off.” It’s meaning relates to the guitar. When a player strums a note on a guitar, then changes the fret on that string, a Hammer-On or Pull-Off occurs. 

HOPOs have a glowing white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color. 

HOPOs are used when notes come in rapid succession, and are always have different set of notes than the ones before. To play a HOPO, you can do so like Strums. But, HOPOs can be played differently.
