# What is Clone Hero?
Clone Hero is exactly as its name implies. It is a Guitar Hero Clone, much like its predecessors, Frets on Fire, Phase Shift, and even modded Guitar Hero 3 on PC as well. Clone Hero is currently in development in the Unity engine, being lead by [Srylain The 2nd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3IfdqGZjhdgQbi_EpfuYg). We are a quickly growing community, and we worry that our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/Hsn4Cgu) won't hold our capacity soon so we bring you this Wiki!
