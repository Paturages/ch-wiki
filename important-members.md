# Developers
## Core Clone Hero Programmers
**Srylain**
Clone Hero creator. Our God.

**mdsitton**
Knowledge with programming, and music theory. Also is in the works of creating his own rhythm game from scratch, as well as a new chart type that is different from a .chart and a .mid file that will (hopefully) be better.

## Core Clone Hero Artists
**Inventor**
One of the two 2D art asset developers on the team.

**TheFilyng**
First artist to join the CH's dev team. Has been working for CH since version 0.04. Mainly works with 2D assets and any other kind of 2D art.

**captaintoasty**
The 3D asset creator on the team, has taken a hiatus from the game.

## New Additions to the Team
**Kolatra**
Our first new addition (alphabetically at least) to the team, an ex Minecraft mod creator and someone with extensive programming knowledge. Also is greatly diverse in his abilities as a programmer, so we welcome him with open arms.

**Omlee**
The new UI designer for Clone Hero, and the creator of an unreleased Rock Band-esque game called Rockporra. They are someone we are proud to bring on board and have working with us.

**PoisonedPanther**
Our head bot developer for the Discord server who also had created a Twitch request bot for CH streamers. He is also someone who will soon be working on the main game itself. Panther and the team will hopefully be working well on implementing integration possibilities between Clone Hero and many other programs like possibly Discord and Twitch.

**ZeroHearts**
The community manager of the project. If you have any questions in regards to streaming as a Twitch Partner, getting your music possibly in Clone Hero officially, or anything community related, talk to him.

**Zerotica**
The developer of the color mod, but also recently brought onto the team to try and work on incorporating his work into the main game. He is one of our new programmers, and a welcomed addition to the team.

## Moonscraper Developer
**Firefox**
Has provided code for Moonscraper (a charting program) to Srylain so that the game can scan charts into the game and check them through internal Moonscraper.

# Discord Team
## Admins
**Chibi**
Our most mysterious member. Wouldn't say anything to add here on the wiki so just take him as is.

**Indi**
Australian gamer, computer nerd and amateur musician. Now, where's that cookie I was promised? Also a baker of bread... Don't ask...

**Jaeden**
Handles things behind the scenes for the Discord server that aren't taken care of by the Dev team.

**Kevin Y.**
Your resident Rock Band guru/fanboy, really weird how he ended up here. You can find him in the very uninteresting state of Ohio, the state that made Rush famous.

**Mac**
The third Aussie on the team, marking the start of the Aussie take over of the Discord staff team. He's a big mac. for you

**Siavash**
Having been part of the Phase Shift community as a charter for over two years before joining the Clone Hero side of things, Siavash is now the head organizer for the Anti Hero setlists and acts as a liaison between the Clone Hero server and Custom Songs Central.

**Sygenysis**
Our resident fretsonfire.org representative, and charter of over 1300 songs as of writing, making his start charting in 2014 for Phase Shift and C3. In his spare time a creative writing and rap battle enthusiast, Sy, Syg, Sygen, or Syggy for short should be fine.
## Mods
**Blake8369**

**dizzy_af**

**JMS**
Has an audio interface.

**Magister Ingenia**
Better known as Yuri.

**m9**
The only German currently on the team and also another former Phase Shift/Frets on Fire community member. Also the owner of the now basically dead Phase Shift discord server. He's been a charter for 4 and a half years as of writing as well, but he still has no idea what he's doing.

**Paturages**
Former JamLegend chart reviewer, sporadic charter, developer and maintainer of chorus, notoriously French... No one really knows what this guy's doing with all his roles.

**ThundahK**
## Helpers

**Jawbreaker**

**KubaF2K**

**Toshibro**

**werty**

## Past Staff
**Aedando**
Our Stratocaster loving past Admin. Hails from the USA and works with Linux as well as Windows so has the know how to get some things to work. Owns a few Kiosk Rock Band guitars, and is pretty skilled at fixing things as well.

**Brodskyb**

**Garrythemod**
He is a mod in many streams, and is a beautiful British AND French man.

**CaGe666**
*Also worked on/runs the C3 Conversion Drive*

**CK12345**
Only Korean-American we have on the team. Used to be the second admin that was added to the team who wasn't a developer, still knows probably more than Zero when it comes to anything.

**drepfawx**
Our Bulgarian past mod and converter, you can find his conversions of Guitar Hero: 80's and Guitar Hero 1 on the spreadsheet that everyone loves. Also is an admin of the Rhythm Games Community Discord Server.

**eddiehead**
The first Brit on the team, an IT manager with a pet snake. What more do we need to say? People with pet snakes are neat.

**ExKirby**

**HellAshes**

**Jayson™**
You have probably seen him in the Clone Hero Discord from the Netherlands who makes tutorials for fun. He's the one with that sexy ass European voice in the backgrounds and highways tutorial. He has also made some good charts and meme charts with his most known one being "The Ting Go Skrra", he is not happy with that. He also likes writing in the third person.

**jdurand11143**
Streamer and organizer of both Carpal Tunnel Hero 1 and 2, as well as a helper to many. A regular American out to help the community and create projects for people to enjoy (and also want to die after playing because their hands feel like they are going to snap).

**L0rd R3n3gad3**

**martti**

**Meowmartius**
The creator of WiitarThing, ensuring no one should have to use GlovePIE or HIDWiimote again.

**Miscellany**

**PoisonedPanther**
The resident Linux pro, also the creator of the work in progress Discord bot. Our resident Canadian former admin as well as the very first admin added to the team that wasn't a developer, enjoys funnybux.

**RobRum**

**Trickii**
A.K.A. TheZombieDon, a past moderator who now charts songs, mainly in the EDM genre and such. He was also known to zip a zip within a zip (don't ask why).

**Tyler**
The Canadian that plays too much Runescape, helps with the Discord bot development with PoisonedPanther.

**Ulric Pickar**
Haha yes

**weebBlue**

**xX760Xx**
Also known as J.P. this man is a legend in all the big streams, but good legends have to start from somewhere right? He has been in the community since 2007, but has only started really getting fully involved this year.(2017)

**ZeroHearts**
The person on the team who knows practically nothing about the GH community as he fully got involved only in August of 2017. Has created things like the Custom Songs spreadsheet, and this wiki, and is a boring ol' American.
