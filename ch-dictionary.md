## Note types
In Clone Hero, there are 5 different **coloured** notes, also called gems or frets: green, red, yellow, blue, and orange. There is also a purple note that is a line across the highway, called an Open Note. It is played by strumming while no frets are held on the controller. Open Notes are typically the lowest note heard in a song, then the frets are in ascending order from lower on the neck (green) to higher (orange).

There are 3 different types of notes: Strums, HOPOs, and Taps.
### Strums
Strums are the most common note found in charts. To play a Strum, hold down the corresponding fret and press up or down the strum bar once.

Strums have a black ring with a white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color.

Strums are used in charts when the notes are “new,” as there is a noticeable new attack.
### HOPOs
**HOPO** stands for “Hammer-On, Pull-Off.” It’s meaning relates to the guitar. When a player strums a note on a guitar, then changes the fret on that string, a Hammer-On or Pull-Off occurs.

HOPOs have a glowing white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color. 

HOPOs are used when notes come in rapid succession, and are always have different set of notes than the ones before. To play a HOPO, you can do so like Strums. But, HOPOs can be played differently.

If you successfully “hit” the note before:
* All HOPOs are played by pressing the colored fret (no strumming).
* Hammer-Ons can be played by pressing the fret, while keeping the previous fret held down, or not.
* Pull-Offs can be played by releasing the higher fret and having the HOPO fret held down when released (this is also called Anchoring).
### Taps
Tap notes are another type of note. To play a Tap, press the fret or pull-off from another fret.

Taps have are slightly darker and transparent.
You may play Tap notes like you would play Strums, but you do not necessarily need to use the strumbar at all with Tap notes.
### Opens
Open notes are the lowest note. To play an Open Strum, simply press the strum bar with no frets pressed down. To play an Open HOPO with the previous note hit, just release all frets.

Open Strums are a solid long purple bar.
