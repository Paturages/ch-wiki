# Very basics of guitar controls
Most likely, you will be playing Clone Hero with a guitar controller.

![Les Paul Controls](/uploads/dictionary/les-paul-controls.jpg "Guitar Controls")

The coloured buttons on the neck of the guitar are called **frets**. The plastic piece that moves in two opposite directions is called the **strumbar**.
You will be using the frets and the strumbar for menu navigation: the green button for confirmation, the red button for cancellation, and the up-down strumbar movements for selecting and navigation.
The metal part of the guitar that moves up and down in a spring-like motion is called the **whammy bar**.
# Notes and note types
Notes descend down the **highway** towards the **strikeline** on the bottom, which represents the hit window for the notes.
**Note speed** affects the speed at which the notes descend, but does not affect the actual song speed. Higher note speed spaces the notes out and may help with faster songs.
## Note types
In Clone Hero, there are 5 different **coloured** notes, also called gems or frets: green, red, yellow, blue, and orange. There is also a purple note that is a line across the highway, called an Open Note. It is played by strumming while no frets are held on the controller. Open Notes are typically the lowest note heard in a song, then the frets are in ascending order from lower on the neck (green) to higher (orange).

There are 3 different types of notes: Strums, HOPOs, and Taps.
### Strums
**Strums** are the most common note found in charts. To play a Strum, hold down the corresponding fret and press up or down the strum bar once when the notes pass the strikeline.

Strums have a black ring with a white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color.

Strums are used in charts when the notes are “new,” as there is a noticeable new attack.
### HOPOs
**HOPO** stands for “Hammer-On, Pull-Off.” It’s meaning relates to the guitar. When a player strums a note on a guitar, then changes the fret on that string, a Hammer-On or Pull-Off occurs. 
![Hopo](/uploads/notes/hopo.png "Hopo"){.align-right}
HOPOs have a glowing white top. The rest of the gem is colored with the corresponding fret color. 

HOPOs are used when notes come in rapid succession, and are always have different set of notes than the ones before. To play a HOPO, you can do so like Strums. But, HOPOs can be played differently.
If you have successfully hit the note before a HOPO, the HOPO can be played without pressing on the strumbar. If you miss a note in a pattern of consecutive HOPO notes, you will have to strum and hit at least one HOPO note like a Strum note, so you regain your note streak and can play the rest of the HOPOs without touching the strumbar again.

The "Pull-Off" part of HOPOs refers to a technique called [**anchoring**](#anchoring).
### Taps
**Tap** notes are another type of note. To play a Tap, press the fret or pull-off from another fret.

Taps have are slightly darker and transparent.
You may play Tap notes like you would play Strums, but you do not necessarily need to use the strumbar at all with Tap notes.
### Opens
![Open Both](/uploads/notes/open-both.png "Open Both"){.align-right}
**Open** notes are the lowest note. To play an Open Strum, simply press the strum bar with no frets pressed down. To play an Open HOPO with the previous note hit, just release all frets.

Open Strums are a solid highway-wide purple bar. Open HOPOs are the same, but have a glowing edge.
## Chords
**Chords** are combinations of different notes played **at the same time**. For example, a Strum note chord consisting of a green note and a yellow note will require you to hold the green and yellow buttons at the same time, and press the strumbar when the chord passes the strikeline.

Important to note: the concept of **anchoring** does not apply to Strum note chords, however still applies to HOPO and Tap note chords.
## Sustains
![Sustain](/uploads/dictionary/sustain-smol.jpg "Sustain"){.align-right}
**Sustains**, also known as "long notes", are notes that require you to hold the coloured note until the sustain is visibly over.
If you stop holding the note early you will not lose your multiplier or note streak, granted you have at least hit the sustain note, however you will miss out on extra points.
The guitar track sound will cut out if you let go of a Sustain note, like it would if you've missed a note.
# Star Power
**Star Power (SP)** helps the player score more points by doubling the current multiplier. Star Power notes look similar to regular notes, and represent a spinning star. 
SP is obtained in **phrases**; each note of the phrase must be hit to obtain. A successful phrase raises the SP Meter by 1/4.
If a sustain note is in a phrase, **whammying** will gradually increase the meter as well, while turning the sustain cyan. This is the only use for the whammy in Clone Hero.

To activate SP, the meter must be at least 1/2 full. A 1/2 filled bar will last for 4 measures of music.
While SP is active, every note will turn cyan.
# Scoring and stars
Stars are awarded based on how well you play, like a grade of your performance.

Each note grants 50 points (plus an extra 50 for each note in a chord) and 25 points per beat that a sustain lasts is added to a base score.
After you hit 10 notes without missing, your **multiplier** will increase, up to 4X. With a 4X multiplier a note would grant 200 points.

Base score is multiplied by your average multiplier to give stars accordingly.
3 stars = 1.0 average multiplier 
4 stars = 2.0 average multiplier
5 stars = 2.8 average multiplier
6 stars = 3.6 average multiplier
7 stars = 4.4 average multiplier
7 stars is roughly equivalent to Rock Band's golden stars.

Solo sections give points based on your total % of notes hit during the solo section. 100% (Perfect Solo!) = 100 points for every note hit, 95-99% (Awesome Solo!) = 50 points for every note, hit, etc.

# Advanced techniques and note patterns
## Anchoring
![Anchoring Example](/uploads/dictionary/anchoring-example.jpg "Anchoring Example"){.align-right}
**Anchoring** is a slightly counter-intuitive game mechanic, unique to Guitar Hero-type games, where you are able to **hold down a lower note, while still hitting the higher note.**

For example, you can hit a blue Strum note, even if you hold a green or red or yellow note, or all of the lower notes, as long as you are holding the blue note and strumming at the correct time.
This makes sense in terms of real guitar play, as you could hold any fret lower than the one you were holding already, and it would not make any difference in the pitch of the note.
Anchoring allows for many note patterns to be much simpler to play.

Anchoring does **NOT** work with Strum chords, however it **does** work with HOPO and Tap note chords.
## Strumming techniques
**Alt-strumming** is alternating up and down presses on the strumbar. This helps hit faster Strum note lines and patterns, when just down or just up strumming is physically impossible because of the speed.

**Rake strumming** is an advanced technique, where the player forms a **rake-like shape** with their strumming hand and hits the strumbar with multiple fingers in one motion. This allows to hit **very** fast strum lines and patterns, where even alt-strumming becomes not enough/physically impossible.
[Here is a video example of rake strumming.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubirEUw5vP8)
## Tapping techniques
**Tapping** is using your strumming (usually right) hand to hit the frets instead of your fretting (usually left) hand. Tapping is useful on fast repeating note patterns.

**Alt-tapping** is alternating your strumming hand and your fretting hand to hit notes, it allows for more speed and usually less strain on the hands than normal tapping.

**Rake tapping** is used for fast trills where Alt Tapping is not fast enough. The basic concept is similar to Rake Strumming, but two fingers on the right hand tap the fret, one after each other, then a finger from the left-hand taps the fret for 3 consecutive taps.
