# Converting from Guitar Hero (.sgh/.tgh)
Use [this tool](https://mega.nz/#!sIZGFSBD!P25YMcnPY9vkYpQfnTlaPe0PtnP9KK0DrTol7DURJro) made by Goulart, GH3toCH, to extract all your GH3 songs automatically making them usable for CH. Be warned they will not have any metadata other than artist and song name. Backup your DATA/PAK folder and follow the instructions on readme.txt, or watch this tutorial made by Acai.

# Converting from Phase Shift/Frets on Fire (Normal Files)
**This does not apply to v21.6.**
Some Phase Shift/Frets on Fire note charts are badly formatted, thus Clone Hero can't read them properly. There's a tool Srylain made called [Midifix](https://goo.gl/xFt3ab) that can try to fix them, but it is only able to fix midi files, not .chart files, and sometimes it can't fix some. Just download it, extract all the files, and then drag and drop your Songs folder __***ONTO***__ the MIDIFix.exe.
