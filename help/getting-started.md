<!-- TITLE: Getting Started -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Getting Started -->

To get started, first [download the game](http://clonehero.net/download). You will need to extract it using a program like [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRar](www.win-rar.com/download.html). The folder that you extracted contains all the game files and is also where you insert your songs, under the `Songs` folder.

**You cannot move the `Clone Hero.exe` file outside of the folder.** Instead, you can create a shortcut by right-click dragging the executable to the desktop, then clicking `Create Shortcut Here`.

Clone Hero comes with one song to play. To get more, you can download more songs on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13B823ukxdVMocowo1s5XnT3tzciOfruhUVePENKc01o/edit#gid=0). Any archives you download will need to be extracted (like extracting the game). Songs go into the `Songs` folder. For better organization, song folders can be put into other folders to create a hierarchy.

Start the game, and now you will need to map your controller. Each controller is different, so refer to the [Controllers](/help/controllers) page for your controller.

Once your guitar is configured, you can begin play.
