<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Controllers -->

Clone Hero currently has Guitar (Solo, Co-op tracks, and Rhythm), GH: Live Guitar (6 note), Bass, and 5 lane Keys instruments available to play.

Drums are planned for the future but are not implemented yet. There will be 4 lane drums, however, which is the Rock Band standard. Guitar Hero drums (5 lanes) WILL be usable, the orange cymbal will just become another green note.

That all being said, for the moment microphone support is not being planned. It may come in the far future after all the core elements of the game come out, and a way is found to track vocals, but at this moment, don't hope for it.

Notes:
Guitar Hero: Live guitars are all the same (except iOS, those don't work). They can connect to any dongle, but you MUST have the Xbox 360 dongle AND Windows 10 (or Linux) AND you have to force the Xbox 360 drivers to use it. Otherwise, you CANNOT strum and hold down frets at the same time. It doesn't work.
