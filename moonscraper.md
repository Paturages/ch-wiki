Moonscraper is a charting program made by Alexander "FireFox" Ong. It features .chart and .mid export. 

### How to Install and Run
To install Moonscraper, join the Discord server to find download links ([https://discord.gg/jEXWpm5]). Under #lastest_version, you will find the download to the latest version. If you want, you can download the latest test build from #test_builds. *Note: These versions of Moonscraper are in development and more prone to crash.*

Once you have downloaded the file, you will need an extracting software to unpackage the .rar ([https://www.7-zip.org/download.html](7zip) or [https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm](WinRAR)). Extract the contents into a folder.
